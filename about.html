    <dd>
      HOA costs usually cover – landscaping, regular maintenance, management fees, any clubhouse amenities such as: pool, spa, workout room/gym, security and/or common area electricity. As far as rules and restrictions of the neighborhood make sure there is nothing that is out of the ordinary – usually the big issue in homeowner associations is parking. Can you park in your own driveway, can you park in any spot in the community and/or can you back in? You may also want to check to see if there are any restrictions to outside decor (example holiday decorations). You may want to research the community, documents, disclosures and neighbors before buying in any subdivision. Once in your community you may want to become an active member and join in on board meetings, etc.
